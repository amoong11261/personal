	<h1>Minesweeper Solver</h1>
	<p>The goal is to solve the original classic minesweeper (use Minesweeper Arbiter here) with highest win rate.</p>

	<p>This solver uses matrix to analysis all unsolved cells. </p>
	<p>It uses linear least square (scipy.optimize.lsq_linear) to find the probability of each unsoved cell. </p>
	<p>So that if a guess is required, the solver can click the cell with lowest probability. </p>
	<p>Current win rate is around 23%. If ignore the situation failing before any open cells, win rate is around 27%.</p>
	
	<h2>Probability can be improved</h2>
	<p>1. This solver clicks cells in the corners first. It is not guaranteed the best start.</p>
	<p>2. If need to guess, the solver will click the one with lowest probability to have a mine. </p>
	<p>    This is not guaranteed best choice because two 50% guess is worse than one 33% guess. </p>
